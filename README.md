## WHAT IS THE  RUMBLEFISH WEB TOOLKIT (RWT)?

The RWT demonstrates how to interact with Rumblefish's API to search for and play music from Rumblefish's music catalog. The RWT contains examples of how to search by mood and keyword, browse playlists, occasions, and sound effects, and play Rumblefish audio tracks with YouTube videos. It's based on the functionality and features of Friendly Music, www.friendlymusic.com. For more info on Rumblefish's API,  checkout https://sandbox.rumblefish.com for documentation and examples.

## WHAT CAN I DO WITH THE RWT?

Build your own music licensing store, add music licensing to your web application, build a music licensing widget, really any application of music licensing on the web. The RWT is configured to use Rumblefish's sandbox API environment which contains a limited number of Rumblefish tracks and can not issue commercial licenses or delivery high quality tracks for download. Contact us when you are ready to set up a production portal to enable these features.
